* Introduction
/eg/ (i.e. exempli gratia) is a fast way to craft, test, and store examples of pure functions.

/eg/ is not a testing suite; instead it acts as a supplement, conceptually being a scratchpad somewhere between the REPL and a full-blown testing suite.

The goal of /eg/ is to 1) make development of pure functions fast, and 2) provide persistent scratchpads for each pure function.

To make development fast, /eg/ tries hard to never leave the current buffer; everything should happen in-line, whenever possible. Thus we prefer in-line display over the echo area. A simple performance metric of /eg/ is how close the information desired is to where the cursor is currently.

To have persistent scratchpads, /eg/ stores examples specific to each pure function. Thus when you change the implementation details of a pure function, you can rerun your examples for sanity-check. Scratchpads can also naturally act as reminder of how a specific function works.

Function-specific scratchpads, by design, are light and not intended to be full-blown tests. But examples are smaller versions of tests, so contents of scratchpads may evolve into tests.

NOTE: /eg/ does not limit itself to pure nor small functions, but is best fit for such use case.

** Demos
TODO

** Features
- ~C-3~ to show your examples inline (TODO: add gif, add keybinding)
- ~C-4~ to run your examples inline (TODO: add gif, add keybinding)
- ~C-c'~ to bring up *eg-live* buffer
  *eg-live* buffer allows you to edit examples associated with current major-mode (i.e. language).
- ~C-c C-'~ to bring up *eg-live-fn* buffer
  *eg-live-fn* buffer allows you to edit examples associated with specific function in the language.
- When used with ~lispy~, ~T~ on a s-expression calls ~lispy-try~ (TODO: change to ~eg-try~), which provides a default form for a function.

* Conceptual Explanation
** Comparison with REPL
/eg/ and REPL may be used in conjunction. Examples in /eg/, as how I use them, are exemplar of the pure function. Since they are persistent, they are a bit more structured than the REPL. By comparison, you have more control over the REPL, and results are discarded. However, I find that for pure functions, the dev cycle with /eg/ is much faster and more sensible.

** Comparison with Testing Suite
/eg/ and testing suite are orthogonal since their use cases are different. For structured, long tests, use a testing suite. If you want to test and record small examples, use /eg/.

* Footnote
/eg/ is inspired by [[https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy][lispy]] and [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck][quickcheck]].
